# Leap-Drone
On our first work with motion control systems we have developed a project which combines the different capabilities of the Leap Motion sensor and the AR.Drone 2.0 quadcopter. The main goal of this project is to control the drone with the hand easily (tracking the different movements and gestures with the Leap Motion sensor). Nowadays this kind of projects can be used and extended to many different application fields or used in a entertainment way.
