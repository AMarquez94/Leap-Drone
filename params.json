{"name":"LeapDrone","tagline":"Ar. Drone 2.0 + Leap motion device","body":"### Welcome to LeapDrone\r\nOn our first work with motion control systems we’ve developed a project which combines the different capabilities of the LeapMotion sensor and the AR.Drone 2.0 quadricopter. The main goal of this project is to control the quadricopter with the hand easily (tracking the different movements and gestures with the LeapMotion sensor). Nowadays this kind of projects can be used and extended to many different application fields or used in a entertainment way.\r\n\r\n[Link to our Youtube video presentation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AQxcPMRUz7o)\r\n\r\n[Link to the presentation slides of the project](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1Wx8TTYvQXKI-hLdGAbIwvpxRmsmiTs4b52G-EhECsBg/edit#slide=id.g35f391192_00)\r\n\r\n\r\n### Authors\r\nAlejandro Márquez Ferrer (Zaragoza, Spain)\r\n\r\nDavid Vergara Manrique (Zaragoza, Spain)\r\n\r\nWenceslao Martínez Suárez (Gijón, Spain)\r\n\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nYou can contact us in the following emails:\r\n\r\ndavidvergara13zz@gmail.com\r\n\r\nalejandromarquez94@gmail.com\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
